# Read me for website unit
Welcome to my page!
This is the final project for my Composing Digital Media class and I created my first website! On this site, I have two projects from earlier this semester: audio narrative and video essay. While doing these projects, I was learning how to use new programs, such as Audacity and Premiere Pro. This website and projects included were all stepping stones to this final product.
