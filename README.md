# Read me for website unit
Welcome to my page!
This is the final project for my Composing Digital Media class, and I’m excited to share my first ever website. On this site, you’ll find two of my earlier projects from the semester: an audio narrative and a video essay. While working on them, I learned how to use new programs like Audacity, Premiere Pro, and Visual Studio Code.

The audio project helped me understand how to edit sound and tell a story through voice and music. The video essay was more challenging, but it taught me a lot about video editing and putting clips together in a way that makes sense. Finally, building this website brought everything together. It was my first time writing code and designing a webpage, and although it was tricky at first, I really enjoyed the process.

I put a navigation bar that users can easily click to go to each project or the home/about me page. With each page, there are links and credits for what was included in each project and I also credited the images on the site itself on here. I either attached the content directly or a link to my project that anyone can assess. All of these projects were steps toward this final product. I’ve learned a lot throughout the course and this site brings everything together into one place.
