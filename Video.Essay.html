    <h1> Overconsumption with Metal Waterbottles</h1>
<p> My video essay explores how metal water bottles—particularly brands like Hydro Flask, Stanley, Owala, and Yeti—have transformed from practical hydration tools into social status symbols. My central argument is that their success is a case study in how marketing, internet culture, and peer influence shape consumer identity. While sustainability plays a role in their popularity, I argue that these bottles are more about lifestyle branding than true environmental consciousness. I chose this subject because I have noticed distinct water bottle trends on my college campus, where certain brands are associated with specific groups of students. This everyday observation led me to consider the larger cultural forces at play, from influencer marketing to the subtle peer pressure of owning the "right" bottle. </p>

<p> The video essay format was ideal for this project because it allowed me to incorporate TikTok clips to illustrate the role of social media in consumer trends. The medium of video enabled me to blend narration with visual evidence, making my argument more engaging than a traditional written essay. I also used college campus footage to ground my discussion in real-world observations, reinforcing my case study approach.</p>
    
<p>While creating this video, I engaged with ongoing conversations about branding, consumer identity, and the commodification of sustainability. Many online discussions, from social media and news articles dive deep into debates, critiquing the rise of "eco-friendly" consumerism as more of a trend than a meaningful shift in behavior. By analyzing viral moments like the VSCO Girl aesthetic and the Stanley Cup craze, I contributed to these conversations by highlighting how internet culture fuels consumer personas.</p>
    
<p> The research and production process was challenging. Editing in Premiere Pro was a very different learning curve compared to Audacity —I experimented with layering visuals, adding transitions, and adjusting pacing to ensure my argument flowed naturally. The feedback from the workshops was helpful as I was refining my final project. Early drafts included too much general discussion about putting transitions in between clips and doing more voiceover instead of showing me speaking. </p>
