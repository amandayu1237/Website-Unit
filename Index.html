  <p> This is the final project for my Composing Digital Media class and I created my first website! On this site, I have two projects from earlier this semester: audio narrative and video essay. Click the links above!! </p>

  <p>While doing these projects, I was learning how to use new programs, such as Audacity and Premiere Pro. This website and projects included were all stepping stones to this final product.</p>
  <h2> Audio Narrative reflection </h2>
  <p> This project was very user friendly and as someone who has never take a digital media course, this was a easy first project. Audacity was very easy to use once I got the hang of things. This was my first time doign any sort of editing, so this was a very tedious process. I was very pleased with how it came out and it was very fun to add my own twist with the audio assets I chose. </p>
<br>
<h2> Video Essay reflection</h2>
<p> This second project was more complex then the first project. I never realized how much time goes into video editting and how complex some programs can be. With the help of classmates and Youtube, I was able to get the hang of things and have my final project. Even though this was my most frusterating project, I am more confident in my skills now then I was in the beginning.</p>
<br>
<h2> Website Unit reflection</h2>
<p> This project was the most interesting by far, I have never learned a concept like this before, so starting out was very confusing. As we practiced in class, I slowly grasped the concepts and it got a bit easier.</p>
<p> I like the creativity that comes with this, but underestimated the process in creating a new site.</p>
