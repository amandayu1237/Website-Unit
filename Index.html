  <p> This is the final project for my Composing Digital Media class and I created my first website! On this site, I have two projects from earlier this semester: audio narrative and video essay. Below I have a reflection for each project and my reaction for each project. </p>
  <br>
  <br>

  <p>While doing these projects, I was learning how to use new programs, such as Audacity, Visual Studio Code, and Premiere Pro. This website and the projects included were all stepping stones to this final product. At first, a lot of these tools felt confusing and unfamiliar, but over time, I started to get the hang of them. Each project taught me something different, and by the end, I could see how they all connected.</p>
  <h2> Audio Narrative reflection </h2>
  <p> This project was a great introduction to digital media. As someone who has never taken a course like this before, I appreciated how approachable it was. Audacity seemed intimidating at first, but after some experimenting, it actually became pretty easy to use. It was my first time doing any kind of editing, so the process felt slow and sometimes tedious. I was able to incoperate funny audio assets, which I had a lot of fun with and gave me the opportunity to put my own spin on the narrative. In the end, I was pleased with what I created, and it gave me confidence to tackle the next project. </p>
<br>
<h2> Video essay reflection</h2>
<p> This second project was more complex then the first project. It was harder and took a lot more time than I expected. I did not realize how much work goes into editing even a short video. Premiere Pro was tough to figure out at first, and sometimes it felt like too much. But I got help from classmates, watched a lot of YouTube videos, and kept trying. This was the hardest project for me, but it also helped me learn the most.</p>
<br>
<h2> Website unit reflection</h2>
<p>Out of all the projects, this one was the most unfamiliar and the most surprising. I would never done anything like building a website before, so starting out felt a little intimidating. HTML and CSS seemed like a different language (literally), but with practice and in-class support, things started to click. I really enjoyed the creativity that came with designing a site from scratch, even though I totally underestimated how much goes into it. There is was a lot of trial and error involved, but seeing my work come together on a live site felt super satisfying.</p>
<br>
<h2> Final thoughts</h2>
<p>This whole class was really interesting, and I am glad I got to learn something so different. I do not think I would have been able to figure all of this out on my own. The programs, the editing, the websiteâ€”it all would have felt way too overwhelming without help. Having classmates to talk to and workshop days in class really made a difference. Being able to ask questions and get feedback helped me stay on track. I learned a lot, and I am pleased with the final product.</p>
